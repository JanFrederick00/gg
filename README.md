# gg

A set of command line tools and [Go](https://golang.org) packages to work with
files in various formats also used by the game engine of [Thimbleweed
Park™](https://thimbleweedpark.com/). Go buy and play the game now, if you
haven't already done so.

The project name "gg" was chosen, because the names of a lot of these formats
start with those two letters, e.g. "ggpack" or "GGDictionary" — most likely
because they were invented by [Grumpy Gamer](grumpygamer.com) (Ron Gilbert).
This project is not related to him or Terrible Toybox, Inc.
