# gg

A set of command line tools and [Go](https://golang.org) packages to work with
data files of the game [Thimbleweed Park](https://thimbleweedpark.com/).

The project name "gg" was chosen, because the names of a lot of these formats
start with those two letters, e.g. "ggpack" or "GGDictionary". They were
conceived by [Grumpy Gamer](grumpygamer.com) (Ron Gilbert). This project is not
related to him or Terrible Toybox, Inc.
